General Purpose Registers:

1.accumulator -> i/p and o/p reg operations : a,ax,eax,rax.
2.base -> holds address of data : b,bx,ebx,rbx.
3.counter -> counts,used in loop : cx,eax,rcx.
4.data -> hold output data : d,dx,edx,rdx.

X  = extended to 16 bits
E = extended to 32 bits
R = Rich reg to 64 bits

5.Code Segment-> holds the address of code segment.
6.Data Segment-> holds the address of data segment.
7.Stack Segment-> holds the address of stack segment.
8.Extra Segment-> holds address of the data segment

9.Source Index-> points the source operand 
10.Destination Index-> points the destination operand 

11.Instrction Pointer-> holds the stack pointer 
12.Stack Poiner->points the top of stack 

13.flag Register->holds current status of the program

14.Base Pointer->Base of the top of stack
